## Abstract
<!-- will write at the end --> 

## Introduction
Online education is a major driving mechanism in the lifelong learning path of healthcare professionals. Despite a large number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses focusing on multiple aspects of online learning applied to healthcare professionals, the speed at which online learning technologies evolve largely defies our ability to create and maintain our reviews up to date. In contrast with this need, the field still largely relies on publications modes that can hardly address the practitioners' needs.

Traditionally, education practice has been driven by more opinion than evidence. It was only recently that the number of randomized experiments and the overall quality in the reporting of other study designs has allowed for the execution of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In education applied to healthcare in specific, recent efforts by researchers such as David Cook and <!-- add others --> have recently led to information that can now guide education policy in ways that were previously not possible. A recent example is <!-- example policy guided by systematic reviews in healthcare education -->

<!-- overview of traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses in online learning applied to healthcare education - work by david cook -->

Despite of a significant increase in the number and quality of systematic reviews in education applied to healthcare, the field is not without problems. First, the time lag between the completion of studies and their inclusion in systematic reviews is still very large. If an additional years are added in order to these systematic reviews to be finally translated into practice guidelines and put into educational practice, we are likely looking at somewhere around 10 years between knowing that something works and then providing society with the benefit of that knowledge. Second, although meta-analysis are conducted with a potentially reproducible methodology, their underlying assumption can and should be put into question. For example, it has been demonstrated that the exact same set of articles in a meta-analysis can lead to fairly different conclusions depending on which articles are included based on a wide range of quality scales (juni1999hazards). However, in its current format, systematic reviews do not allow researchers and policy makers to attempt alternative assumptions, presenting instead a monolythic, falsely objective view of the literature. 

As an alternative to the problems previously outlined, in the past few years semantic technologies now allow for databases to be dynamically created and distributed. <!-- ref book semantic web allemang --> Specifically, the [Linked Open Data movement](http://linkeddata.org/) allows for research articles to not only be published with a number of data points on each article that greatly supersedes the traditional PubMed abstracts <!-- pubmed -->, but also to bring in information about these articles that were previously not available. A typical example is the potential to map individual articles to the geographic locations where the studies were conducted, therefore assisting readers in evaluating whether their results might or not be relevant to them as a function of their similarity with the local population where these results might be eventually applied in educational practice.

In light of the current issues with the literature, the objective of this article is to demonstrate a semantic, dynamic framework for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in online learning applied to healthcare education, where results can be dynamically displayed and stratified.

### Demonstration systematic review and meta-analysis articles

We used for this study two systematic reviews [Liu et al., 2013](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMUEhhNHJIX0E5anc/edit) and [Cook et al., 2010](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMSXhCLWpzcnpOUEU/edit). The systematic review by Liu et al., 2013 included 9 studies: [Bloomﬁeld et al. 2010](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMVW5aM2pKYlAySnc/edit), [Chiu et al. 2009](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMZHlWQkFGMkN6TmM/edit),[Fernández Alemán et al. 2011](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMa1BQXzkyUmw0SDg/edit), [Gerdprasert et al. 2010](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMMEhoMk53c0JhdGs/edit), [Horiuchi et al. 2009] (https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMQ2NrcTJEbXN5MjA/edit), [Lu et al. 2009](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMV18yMHppbGV1SFU/edit), [Mäkinen et al. 2006](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMR2IwRG1GVzd6aEE/edit), [McMullan et al. 2011](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMNmp6YmdCdnk0U28/edit), [Smeekens et al. 2011](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-L3GiehWhDMM1M3OXpBX2VVbkU/edit).

<!-- Tais, please add here a description of the systematic review we will use, how many rcts it has, and links to the rcts. also add a meta-analysis of your choice focused on online learning applied to healthcare professionals - would choose something where there are around 15 RCTs included, just so that we have a bit of room to stratify the results later on -->

The extracted data are provided as a CSV (comma-separated values) under FigShare <!-- add link once available --> as well as a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuL3GiehWhDMdDVTRmtmV185ajMxbEZxd2plTllCNEE#gid=0). Finally, as will be detailed below, the data are made available in a directly queriable format through our SPARQL endpoint <!-- link and define sparql -->, from which a direct analysis can also be performed.

 that can be downloaded as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file.


### Use case
Informal use case](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/systemUseCase.htm)

Table 1. Informal use case

* User go to the Web site and either browses or searches across systematic reviews and  RCTs
* For each systematic review, the user can stratify results based on a set of fields from an existing ontology that are present within that systematic review
* Results are presented in both a qualitative as well as, when available, a quantitative perspective
* For qualitative results a table and Venn diagram showing overlapping characteristics are displayed
* For quantitative results, OR with 95% CI and a forest plot are displayed

### Ontology structure

<!-- 
There are two vocabularies that we can model the data: RDF Data Cube (www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) and DCAT (http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/).
I'm delineating pros and cons of them. http://semanticweb.com/tag/data-cube-vocabulary

For now we are using RDF Data Cube.
-->


Our ontology engineering process used concepts from the [UPON](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4Ke-17mTW1_eWZpeUNRa2pUVVE/edit) and [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) methodology in that we used a use-case rather than realist approach and worked in iterative cycles focused on the aims of our stakeholders. Briefly, we used the following steps:

1. Defined a simple use case, specifically focusing on the end-product our users were expected to get from the application
1. Outlined main sections from each component articles in the Cook meta-analysis, including both qualitative and quantitative 
2. Outlined a first version of the ontology and instantiated it with data
3. Conducted a meta-analysis using the instances by directly importing the RDF into the R language
<!-- r citation --> and [meta package]()
1. Released a qualitative table outlining the main characteristics of each study
1. Presented the result to an educator and went back to the beginning of the cycle to address any issues


<!-- each subpopulation dyad (proportion of the number of successes over the total number of people) is specific for dyad each result dyad(specific outcome and specific intervention arm). For example, assume that a trial is comparing two arms (control vs. educational intervention A) for three outcomes (course completion, satisfied with course, and would recommend course to others). the following points have to be captured for this trial: rate of course completion for control (total number of students who completed course vs total number of students), rate of course completion for intervention, rate of satisfaction for control, ... -->

<!-- Jacson, cito is included in knitcitations and only requires the DOI - do you know whether DOI is included in the pubmed lod? a connection with cito could lead in another paper toward a facilitated search for additional rcts if we connect it to the pubmed API to search for related articles. could also do some hacking of google scholar in order to get citing and cited articles. see http://goo.gl/wvQEdG for an example. all of this is not for now, this will be part of the discussion section as future development -->

### Statistical analysis

All analyses were conducted using the R language (@R2013). Specifically, we accessed the data through the previously created SPARQL endpoint using the rrdf package(@rrdf2013) package for rdf manipulation. The data were then converted into a dataframe, which is the equivalent of a flat table. Subsequently, we used the [meta](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meta/index.html) package for meta-analysis and forest plot and the [QCA](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/thiem-dusa.pdf) and [Venn diagram](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VennDiagram/VennDiagram.pdf) package for qualitative analysis.
